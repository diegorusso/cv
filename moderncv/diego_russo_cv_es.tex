\section{About me}
\cvline{}{Because of \textbf{my passion for computing}, I have developed over the years wide range of skills many areas computer-related. During the years of higher education, beyond academic success, I created and maintained an \textbf{above average} extra-curricular activity: among other initiatives in which I participated, I remember ''The basic course on multimedia'',''Exposcuola 2000 in Paestum'', ''Basic computer as tutor role'', ''Computer literacy course as tutor to senior people (over 65 years old)'', ''XI week of scientific and technological culture'', ''Pluto Meeting 2001'' and ''Main tutor of a group of 6 people for the course of IMPROVING ITALIAN for new students in the project ''Reception, Recovery, Empowerment in early grades''''. In all the projects mentioned, I participated actively devoting time and effort in learning new things about new information technology and other subjects. From the moment I had my first computer, I have had a certain passion for the \textbf{open source} world and all that concerns it: in fact I have managed machines with \textbf{Linux} distributions such as RedHat 7.3, Slackware 7.1 up to machines to Debian (from version 3.0 to current ones). Through this experience I have gained skill and knowledge in the management of Linux: bash scripting, configuring and compiling the kernel, network services, patching the kernel, C language. In addition to Linux, I daily use OSX. I was active as a contributor to the writing of the guide \url{http://www.ubuntusemplice.org/} (version 6.06 and 7.10). On this project I was the reviewer and author of several chapters, I administered the machine that hosts the site, wiki, blog and mailing list. \textbf{I also have a great passion for programming languages} knowing many of them. I studied LSL during my work on \textbf{Second Life}: in fact I have worked on many Italian metaverse project such as Assis \url{http://www.secundavita.it}, Milan and Marostica on the \textbf{''Italia Vera''} project.\newline
I have a good knowledge of graphic applications (Gimp, Photoshop) and office tools such as Openoffice.org and iWork (for OSX)\newline
Determenated, I can work both in a team and individually and I am able to manage independently my workflow. Working usually in a team, I have a constructive and collaborative relationship with the people around me, such as colleagues and collaborators. I am sociable, friendly and with good communication skills; my site is a source of continuing social contact and exchange with other technical and less technical people.}
