\section{Desired employment}
\cvline{}{\large\textbf{I'm always looking for a challenging position where I can express and use my passion for programming and technology. I mostly develop in Python in *NIX environment on a daily basis. As I'm a dynamic person, professional and personal growth are very important to me.}}

\section{Experience}
\subsection{Vocational}
\cventry{\textbf{2013/11--Current Position}}{Staff Software Engineer in DSG (Development Solutions Group)}{ARM Ltd, \url{http://www.arm.com/}}{Cambridge}{}{Working in the \textbf{GNU} team, our goal is the delivery of the \textbf{GNU toolchain} i\textit{(ld, newlib, binutils, gas, gcc, libffi, g++, gfortran, libgomp, libstdc++)} optimized for ARM processors. I am responsible of the infrastructure for automatic builds, tests and benchmarks. It is a bespoke solution written entirely in \textbf{Python} that automatizes all the phases of the process: checkout of the code (using GIT), build and systematic tests (DejaGnu) through LSF (Load Sharing Facility). I am developing an application that collects all the tests' outcome and stores them into a database (\textbf{MongoDB}). I am also designing for analysing those data to find error root causes, trends, common patterns and automatising the tracking of errors using JIRA. For this task I am using \textbf{Flask} for APIs, \textbf{Bootstrap} and \textbf{AngularJS} for the frontend side. The plan for the future is to integrate also benchmarks into the build system (\textit{CoreMark, Dhrystone, Spec2K})}

\cventry{2011/10--2013/10}{Senior Software Developer in Engineering IT Department}{ARM Ltd, \url{http://www.arm.com/}}{Cambridge}{}{Working in a team, I'm involved in many internal projects using \textbf{CentOS} and mainly the following languages: \textbf{Python, Java, Perl, C, tcsh and bash}. I developed from scratch a reliable and fault tolerant application that interacts with the cluster (\textbf{LSF}) and a AMQ server (\textbf{RabbitMQ}). For this project the main language has been Python using a NOSQL database (\textbf{MongoDB} configured as \textit{ReplicaSet}). I've also developed a JIRA plugin to interact with an internal software in order to synchronise external tickets with internal ones. I look after, improve and fix many IT internal software using a wide range of languages. I've got experience also with LSF cluster, customizing deeply its behaviour in order to provide a functional solution to our customer. Other minor projects are related to \textbf{SVN hooks}, FlexNet Manager server, LSF monitor, internal application interacting with distributed storage. With a colleague of mine, I'm running the IT ECS (\textit{Early Career Scheme}), managing all the phases from the CV sifting to the early career in ARM of graduates and interns.}

\cventry{2006/12--2008/08 2009/09--2011/09}{Python/Django Programmer}{Consorzio Miles - Servizi Integrati, Rome}{Assisi}{}{Working in a team, I developed a management application for the municipality of Bettona using Django, Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, Apache, for the \textbf{computerization of services}, the management of personal data, building practices, urban planning, calculation of ICI tax and updating of land registry data. Also I created an advanced web interface for sending proposed practices, on-line services conference, integration process, exploration of cadastral map in \textbf{DXF} and production of customized automated printing. During the project I used revision control systems (SVN/GIT) with related web interface (trac) to manage tickets.}

I initially worked on \textbf{embedded systems} (ubnt, alix, pcengines), customizing the operating system (ubnt, openwrt) and the software to manage authentication (hostapd, wpa-supplicant). After this first phase, I focused on the software \textbf{to flash} these devices and on large-scale production software. Also, we developed a complete solution for managing \textbf{hotspots}: I worked on server-side development to manage authentication, sessions log, signups, signals management from remote devices, integration with our management software, payment via credit card and authentication via SMS, complying with Pisanu law. My final task was to create software for network monitoring. It is a \textbf{PyQT stand-alone} application, using internal django based API. The technologies mostly used are Python/Django with PostgreSQL database on Debian OS virtualized on XEN}

\section{About me}
\cvline{}{Because of \textbf{my passion for computing}, I have developed over the years a wide range of skills many areas computer-related.\newline
During the years of higher education, beyond academic success, I created and maintained an \textbf{above average} extra-curricular activity: among other initiatives in which I participated, I remember ''The basic course on multimedia'',''Exposcuola 2000 in Paestum'', ''Basic computer as tutor role'', ''Computer literacy course as tutor to senior people (over 65 years old)'', ''XI week of scientific and technological culture'', ''Pluto Meeting 2001'' and ''Main tutor of a group of 6 people for the course of IMPROVING ITALIAN for new students in the project ''Reception, Recovery, Empowerment in early grades''''. In all the projects mentioned, I participated actively devoting time and effort in learning new things about new information technology and other subjects.\newline
From the moment I had my first computer, I have had a certain passion for the \textbf{open source} world and all that concerns it: in fact I have managed machines with \textbf{Linux} distributions such as RedHat 7.3, Slackware 7.1 up to machines to Debian (from version 3.0 to current ones). Through this experience I have gained skill and knowledge in the management of Linux: bash scripting, configuring and compiling the kernel, network services, patching the kernel, C language. In addition to Linux, I daily use OSX.\newline
I was active as a contributor to the writing of the guide \url{http://www.ubuntusemplice.org/} (version 6.06 and 7.10). On this project I was the reviewer and author of several chapters, I administered the machine that hosts the site, wiki, blog and mailing list.\newline
\textbf{I also have a great passion for programming languages} knowing many of them. I studied LSL during my work on \textbf{Second Life}: in fact I have worked on many Italian metaverse project such as Assis \url{http://www.secundavita.it}, Milan and Marostica on the \textbf{''Italia Vera''} project.\newline
I have a good knowledge of graphic applications (Gimp, Photoshop) and office tools such as Openoffice.org and iWork (for OSX)\newline
Determined, I can work both in a team and individually and I am able to independently manage my workflow. Working usually in a team, I have a constructive and collaborative relationships with the people around me. I am sociable, friendly and with good communication skills; my site is a source of continuing social contact and exchange with other technical and less technical people.}
