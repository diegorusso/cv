Since the years of higher education, beyond the academic success, I created and maintained an extra-curricular activity \textbf{above average}: among other initiatives in which I participated remember ''The basic course on multimedia'',''Exposcuola 2000 in Paestum'', ''Basic computer as tutor role'', ''Computer literacy course as tutor to senior people (over 65 years old)'', ''XI week of scientific and technological culture'', ''Pluto Meeting 2001'' and ''Main tutor of a group of other 6 people for the course of ITALIAN IMPROVING for new students in the project ''Reception, Recovery, Empowerment in early grades''''. In all the projects mentioned, I participated actively devoting time and effort in learning new things about the new information technology and other.

From my first computer, I had a certain passion for the \textbf{open source} world and all that concerns him: in fact I managed machines with \textbf{Linux} distributions such as RedHat 7.3, Slackware 7.1 up to machines to Debian (from version 3.0 to current ones). Through this experience I have gained some skill and knowledge in the management of Linux: bash scripting, configuring and compiling the kernel, network services, patching the kernel, C language. In addition to Linux, I daily use OSX. Given the continued use and my passion for computers I have in-depth study of the latter.

I was active as contributor to the writing of the guide \url{http://www.ubuntusemplice.org/} (version 6.06 and 7.10). In this project I was reviewer and author of several chapters, I administered the machine that hosts the site, wiki, blog and mailing list.

\textbf{I also have a great passion for the programming languages}: I know many of them in several areas such as Python, C, PHP, Java, LSL (Linden Scripting Language). I studied LSL during my work on \textbf{Second Life}: in fact I worked on many projects in the metaverse as Italian Assis \url{http://www.secundavita.it}, Milan and Marostica in \textbf{''Italia Vera''} project.
I have a good knowledge of graphic applications (Gimp, Photoshop) and office tools such as Openoffice.org and iWork (for OSX)}
